These would be products that drew from the old-world principles of winemaking, craftsmanship and a sense of true luxury. They would be made from the finest quality ingredients in the world, offer unprecedented multi-correctional activity and be completely safe. The first product to bring these extreme standards around efficacy, quality and safety was Active Botanical Serum in 2014 and the second Active Treatment Essence in 2019. \nTogether, Essence and Serum deliver complete nutrition to the skin to drive unprecedented multi-correctional results and lasting change.\n\nWe believe in giving back and with that in mind are proud to share 2% of every purchase with charities dedicated to protecting, educating and empowering woman and children around the world.\""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "fd3261be-224f-49ee-bce9-15d32d85ebaf", "children": ["e23b5636-9082-4e16-9988-d7721f3d45c6"]}, "e23b5636-9082-4e16-9988-d7721f3d45c6": {"id": "e23b5636-9082-4e16-9988-d7721f3d45c6", "message": {"id": "e23b5636-9082-4e16-9988-d7721f3d45c6", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1694936530.681308, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["```json\n{\n    \"category\": \"other\",\n    \"summary\": \"Vintner's Daughter is dedicated to providing skincare products that are transformative, of the highest quality, and safe.

By combining cutting-edge genome analysis with the latest technological breakthroughs in AI we develop analytical tools delivering key answers to patients and clinicians.\n\nAt MNM, our goal has always been to understand cancer and find the right therapy for every patient. We set out on this journey analyzing somatic variants of patient tumors to guide their therapy. Soon, we realized that there is much more valuable information than only a coding DNA sequence in the patient\u2019s tumor; however, we needed more genomes with clinical data to fully understand cancer origins. We started a BioBank and began building the database of whole-genome sequencing data, which led to the creation of custom data processing pipelines, distributed computation, and storing results in the cloud. With rich datasets at hand, now we can use machine learning to drive our success. We have developed and patented custom CDK4/6i, HRD, and PD1i patient stratification algorithms. The analysis of patient response to existing therapies inspired our broader vision We have realized that our genome analysis technology can reveal patterns of cancer mutations related to genes that are not yet targeted by any therapy. It is this realization that lies at the heart of our unique approach. We do not follow a classical drug target discovery approach - from basic science to in vitro models and clinical trials. Our solution starts from real patient data and leverage AI and bioinformatics to understand mutation profiles and find relevant target candidates. And we are already doing it by creating our drug - MNM177!\n\nTo follow this path, we are building a unique field that unites life scientists and data scientists. Together, we can answer questions at the core of cancer development.
